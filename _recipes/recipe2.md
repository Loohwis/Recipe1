Kare-Kare has a unique flavour profile, combining the sweetness of the peanut sauce with the savoury flavours of the meat and vegetables. Its thick and creamy consistency, along with the addition of bagoong, adds an umami depth of flavour                   

Kare-Kare is a dish that embodies the Philippines' culinary diversity, as it combines indigenous ingredients such as peanuts with Spanish and Chinese cooking techniques. It is also a dish that represents Filipino ingenuity, as it was originally made with oxtail, an inexpensive cut of meat that was transformed into a flavourful and nutritious dish through slow-cooking and the addition of flavourful ingredients.
