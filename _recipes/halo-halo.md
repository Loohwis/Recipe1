Halo-Halo is a popular Filipino dessert that is popular all year, but especially during the summer. It literally means "mix-mix" in Tagalog, referring to how the dessert is assembled by combining all of the ingredients. It's a colourful and refreshing dessert that typically includes a variety of sweet beans, fruits, jellies, and ice cream, all served over shaved ice and drizzled with evaporated and condensed milk. Halo-Halo is a well-known cultural icon in the Philippines, often associated with happy childhood nostalgiaÂ and family gatherings.
